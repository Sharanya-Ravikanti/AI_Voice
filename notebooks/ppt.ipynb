            "                       Plastic waste management is increasingly challenging due to the growing use of single-use plastics and plastic films, which often end up in landfills or natural ecosystems. Recycling facilities encounter specific issues when handling thin plastic sheets and films, as these materials easily become tangled, creased, or damaged during processing. This leads to higher wastage, lowered recycling quality, and increased labor costs for manual handling and sorting. Currently available machines are either not tailored for the delicate nature of plastic films or lack automation, causing inefficiencies and delays in the recycling workflow.\n",

            "Solution Statement:\n",
            "                       The proposed solution is an Automated Plastic Rewinding Machine that efficiently rewinds plastic films and sheets onto rolls, preventing creasing, tangling, and damage. This machine would feature adjustable settings to handle different plastic types and thicknesses, allowing it to be versatile and adaptable for various recycling needs. By automating the rewinding process, this machine reduces the need for manual intervention, speeds up the recycling process, and lowers operational costs. This innovation aims to improve the efficiency and sustainability of plastic recycling facilities, enhancing their capacity to process plastic waste and contributing to overall environmental conservation efforts.\n",
